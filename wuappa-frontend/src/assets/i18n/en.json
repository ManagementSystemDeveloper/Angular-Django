Scope<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>These Terms and Conditions (&quot;T&amp;C&quot;) are intended to present the rules of use of the mobile application &quot;Wuappa&quot; (hereinafter &quot;The Application&quot;).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &quot;Wuappa&quot; Application is published and operated by the Company &quot;B-Rush S&agrave;rl&quot; (hereinafter &quot;The Operator&quot;), a company whose registered office is at Route de la Capite 20, 1223 Cologny, Canton of Geneva , Switzerland, company registered in the commercial register of this canton.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>All persons installing and \/ or using the Application (hereinafter &quot;the Users&quot;) acknowledge to be bound by these General Conditions, which they declare to have read and understood and undertake to respect them without reserve. These Terms and Conditions may be consulted at any time on the Application.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Operator reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify these Terms and Conditions at any time. Users are responsible for consulting them regularly in order to keep themselves informed of any changes. Any changes made by the Operator are brought to the attention of Users by their mere posting. They are deemed accepted without reservation by any User who accesses the application after the posting.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Purpose of the Application<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Application serves as an intermediary between hairdressers and people wishing to be styled at home (these two groups hereinafter referred to together as &quot;Users&quot;).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through the platform provided by the Application, Users are able to easily find a hairdresser who suits them and who moves directly to their home in due time or customers wanting to be styled.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. Provision of the application<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to use the Application, Users must be in possession of the following:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>o An Apple iPhone or iPad with the IOS 11 operating system or higher or Android OS;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>o Internet Access.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4.

It is the performance of the obligation of intermediation by the Operator that is relevant.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4.3 Payment<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Operator offers Users the following payment terms: Credit Card.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Users wishing to use the services of the hairdressers will have to pay 100% of the payment relating to the service that will perform them through the payment agency provided by the Operator. 80% (eighty percent) of this amount will go to the concerned hairdresser (less the affiliation fees to the paying agency) and 20% (twenty percent) will go to the Operator. The paying agency will make payments every 7 (seven) days.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Generally, the price of the service must be paid in full by the Users upon conclusion of the contract.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In certain cases, the Operator may, at its sole discretion, issue an invoice to Users following the service ordered. In this case, if the invoice is not paid within the aforementioned period, Users will immediately be notified. As soon as the notice of default is given, the Users undertake to pay default interest of 5% (five per cent).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Operator reserves the right to demand the payment of an advance at any time and without giving reasons.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is not possible for the Users to compensate any claim on the amount of the invoice that they must pay to the Operator.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Operator reserves the right to waive service in case of late payment.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5. Cancellation of the order<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>When a contractual deadline is provided, the cancellation of an order does not generate any additional cost if the Users cancel their order at least 4 (four) hours before this deadline.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In case of default or in case of late cancellation, the following additional costs will be due:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If the cancellation is made 3 (three) hours before the agreed time, 50% (fifty percent) of the agreed price is due;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If the cancellation is made 1 (one) hour before the agreed time, 100% (one hundred percent) of the agreed price is due.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>6.
